Kayleen Carlson Predictive Modeling Week 8 Creating a GitHub Account

**Week 1:**

1.  I learned what an R Markdown file was and how to use it. I will
    always use them going forward.  
2.  I learned about model variance and bias and the tradeoffs associated
    with higher and lower values of each and how to choose an optimal
    model.

**Week 2:**

1.  I learned how to normalize data. Normalization is having absolute
    quantaties rather than relative.  
2.  I looked into the differences between exploratory and explanatory
    analysis and know that both are equally necessary.

**Week 3:**

1.  I learned how to use boxplots to see distributions by class to
    determine whether or not to include the variables in the next step
    of building the model.  
2.  I learned about different ways to measure the quality of model
    predictions. I liked the method of residual error.

**Week 4:**

1.  I learned about confusion matricies and how to measure precision and
    recall based off of the true positives, true negatives, false
    positives and false negatives.  
2.  I learned about the ROC curve and how to use it with binary
    classifiers. Looking at the area under the curve we can compare
    classifiers.

**Week 5:**

1.  I learned that Generalized linear models are a form of regression
    model where the data is not normally distributed.
2.  I learned that a gamma regression is appropriate when the
    distribution of the target variable is non-negative and skewed to
    the right on a histogram.

**Week 6:**

1.  I learned how to prune a decision tree model which is removing one
    or more splits in order to produce the best model.
2.  I learned that gradient boosting machines are prone to overfitting
    and it takes careful work to make sure they are not overfit.

**Week 7:**

1.  I learned that it takes a really long time for R to determine the
    optimal number of k means clusters with really large datasets.  
2.  I learned that google news uses unsupervised learning algoithms to
    search across all news sources to gather information.

**Week 8:**

1.  I learned that all of this data analyis is useless unless you can
    communicate your results.  
2.  I leaned what Github is and how to use it to collaborate with
    others.
